Monitoring Best Practices in Kubernetes
1. Separate Namespace
Deploy Prometheus and Grafana in a dedicated namespace (e.g., monitoring) to isolate observability tools from application microservices.
This brings benefits like:

Easier user permission management
Resource limits (CPU/memory) via Kubernetes quotas
Clear separation for upgrades, troubleshooting, and maintenance
2. Persistent Volumes
Ensure that Prometheus and Grafana retain important data across restarts:

Use Persistent Volumes (PVs) for Prometheus to keep historical metrics
Use PVs for Grafana to persist dashboards and configuration
3. Label-Based Discovery
Label your services and pods consistently so Prometheus can discover them automatically.
This ensures that metrics are still collected after updates or scaling.

Recommended labels:

app: my-service
monitoring: "true"
PrometheusSelector Example:

matchLabels:
  monitoring: "true"
4. Use ServiceMonitor / PodMonitor
Use special configuration files called ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor to tell Prometheus which services or pods it should collect data from:

These objects are part of the Prometheus Operator and help define what Prometheus should monitor. They automatically adapt to changes in your deployments.

5. Dashboards as Code
Avoid manual configuration in environments:

Store Grafana dashboards as version-controlled files (JSON)
Use Helm or config maps to provision dashboards and data sources
This ensures consistency and easier collaboration
6. Optional: Access Control
Secure your monitoring tools:

Protect Prometheus and Grafana with authentication (e.g., via Rancher)
Use TLS for encrypted connections
Apply role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions
7. Version Visibility
Expose application version information as a custom Prometheus metric:

Helps track which version is currently deployed
Makes it easier to correlate performance changes or issues with specific releases
Visualize versions in Grafana dashboards
8. Alerting Rules
Set up meaningful and actionable alerts:

Define rules such as:

High error rate
Pod restart count > 5
Slow response time
Use PrometheusRule CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) if working with Prometheus Operator
