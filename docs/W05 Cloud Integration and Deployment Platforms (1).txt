Deployment models: from on-premise to SaaS
• Virtualization is the backbone of cloud
computing

• Virtualization allows managed service providers
(MSPs) to deliver IT services in 3 models
1. IaaS: MSP delivers VM to customers
2. PaaS: MSP delivers environments to customers
(e.g. database as a service, managed RabbitMQ
service, etc)
3. SaaS: MSP delivers entire application for the
customer

On-premise
• Full responsibility: hardware → network → operating system → applications
• High control, high maintenance
• Use cases: banks, secure data centers

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
• Provider manages: virtualization, hardware, networking
• You manage: operating system, runtimes, data, applications
• Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM
Cloud, …

• Advantages
• Highly exible and highly scalable
• Accessible by multiple users
• Cost-effective

Platform as a service (PaaS)
•
•
•
•

Provider also manages: operating systems, middleware, runtime
You manage: application and data
Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service
Advantages

• Accessible by multiple users
• Scalable: customers can choose from various tiers of computing resources to suit the
size of their business

• Built on virtualization technology
• Easy to run without extensive system administration knowledge

• Trade-offs: less control, more speed

DevOps — W05 Cloud Integration and Deployment Platforms

11

Software as a service (SaaS)
•
•
•
•

Everything managed by the provider
You use the software via browser/API
Examples: GitHub, Google Docs, Salesforce, Adobe Creative Cloud
Advantages

• Zero deployment: available over the Internet, and usable any time as long as there is
an internet connection

• Scalable, with different tiers for small, medium and enterprise-level businesses
• Ideal for small businesses or startups who cannot develop their own software
applications

• Inclusive, offering security, compliance and maintenance as part of the cost

• Pitfall: minimal customization, vendor lock-in, high costs

Why deployment models evolve
• Drivers: cost, scalability, maintenance, agility
• Question: “should we own the infrastructure or rent it?”
• Analogy: owning a car vs. using ride-sharing

Hybrid and multi-cloud
• Combine on-premise with cloud (e.g., for compliance)
• Multi-cloud for redundancy or negotiation leverage
• Example: Net ix uses AWS + backup on GCP

Serverless: event-driven and fully abstracted infrastructure
• De nition: you deploy code, the platform manages runtime and infrastructure
(pay per execution)

• Also called function as a service (FaaS)
• Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions
• Characteristics
•
•
•
•

Zero infrastructure management
Autoscaling to zero
Stateless functions
Use case: image processing on S3 upload, cron jobs, lightweight APIs

LLM inference as a service
•
•
•
•

Conceptually between SaaS and PaaS
Operationally triggered via FaaS or other compute models
Example: GPT-4.1 in Microsoft Azure is consumed as a managed API service
You don’t host or scale the model yourself—you send a prompt, and Azure
handles the infrastructure, scaling, model optimization, and response

Aspect

Description

Delivery Model

SaaS like (abstracted), exposed via REST API

Provider

Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service

Infrastructure

Fully managed, runs on Azure superclusters (not visible to the user)

Scaling

Handled transparently by Azure (concurrent requests, rate-limited per quota)

Integration Options

Any compute platform (FaaS, PaaS, VM, client-side)

Pricing

Per-token billing

33

Privacy and security in cloud deployment models
• 🧩 Common assumption: “if we run everything ourselves (on-premise), it’s
private and secure”

• Control over hardware and data location
• No external access to infrastructure
• Seen as compliance-friendly, especially in regulated sectors

• 🧨 The misconception: “owning the servers means better security”
• Reality: security depends on expertise, not ownership
• On-premise breaches often result from
• Unpatched systems
• Weak internal access control
• Poor logging and monitoring

• “You’re only as secure as your least informed admin”
© 2025 Stephan Krusche, Ingo Weber

DevOps — W05 Cloud Integration and Deployment Platforms

34

🏗 Cloud reality
• Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) have
•
•
•
•

Dedicated security teams (often 24/7, with red/blue teams)
Automated patching and hardened systems
Proven compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC2, etc.)
Shared responsibility model: cloud provider secures infrastructure, you secure your
usage

• 🔁 Takeaway message
• On-premise gives you control—but not necessarily competence
• Cloud gives you abstraction—but demands accountability

© 2025 Stephan Krusche, Ingo Weber

DevOps — W05 Cloud Integration and Deployment Platforms

35

Pricing and cost considerations
•
•
•
•

Pricing models: pay-as-you-go, reserved instances, spot pricing
Hidden costs: bandwidth, cold storage retrieval, API calls
Cloud calculators: AWS pricing calculator, Azure cost estimator
FinOps: cost optimization is a skill

© 2025 Stephan Krusche, Ingo Weber

DevOps — W05 Cloud Integration and Deployment Platforms

36

Lock-in and portability
• APIs are proprietary: migrating between clouds is non-trivial
• Examples
• S3 APIs ≠ GCS APIs
• IAM (identity and access management) roles differ vastly

• Mitigations
• Use open standards (e.g., open container initiative, Kubernetes)
• Use infrastructure as code (IaC) and abstraction tools

© 2025 Stephan Krusche, Ingo Weber

DevOps — W05 Cloud Integration and Deployment Platforms

37

Compliance and data residency
•
•
•
•

Global cloud regions and availability zones
Sensitive data and legal boundaries (e.g., GDPR, Schrems II)
Question: can the government potentially access data?
Azure Germany, Sovereign Cloud, AWS GovCloud

Recap: what you did
•
•
•
•
•

Launch EC2 instance manually via AWS Console
SSH into instance
Install required tools (e.g. docker + docker compose)
Set up users and access rights
Deploy a client server application using Github actions

DevOps — W05 Cloud Integration and Deployment Platforms

71

The problem with manual setup
•
•
•
•

Error-prone and inconsistent
Time-consuming and hard to scale
No version control or audit possibilities
Dif cult handover between teams

• Remember Jez Humble: “if it hurts, do it more frequently, and bring the pain
forward” → automation

72

Infrastructure as code (IaC)
• De nition: declarative or procedural de nitions of infrastructure in code
• Treat infrastructure like software
• Versioned in git
• Reviewed via pull requests
• Tested and validated

• Analogy: Docker le for VM setups

73

Terraform
• Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp
• Allows you to de ne and manage cloud and on-premises infrastructure using
con guration les

• Example: provision EC2 instances on AWS (no manual clicks)
• Tutorial: https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-ec2-instance

• Build, change, and version infrastructure safely and ef ciently by using a
consistent work ow to provision and manage all your resources

• Uses a declarative con guration language, HashiCorp con guration
language (HCL), to describe the desired state of your infrastructure

Ansible
• Open source automation platform used for managing, deploying, and
con guring IT infrastructure

• Automates tasks like software deployment, con guration management, and
application deployment

• Example: Allows you to install all requirements on the EC2 instance and setup
everything necessary for the CI/CD pipeline

• Relies on modules that perform speci c actions, such as installing software or
managing services, and uses YAML for de ning con guration

GitOps and IaC best practices
•
•
•
•

Version control all infrastructure
Use CI/CD to deploy infrastructure changes
Avoid drift: reconcile state regularly
Secrets: never hard-code, instead use a vault (e.g. HashiCorp Vault) or e.g.
AWS secrets manager

• Recommendation for Github: store secrets in Settings → Security →
Secrets and variables → Actions

• Then the CI/CD pipeline has access to them

From VMs to Kubernetes: the next step
• Motivation: EC2 + Docker Compose was step one, now let’s go cloud-native
• Challenge: Kubernetes YAMLs are verbose and hard to manage
• Solution: Helm – the package manager for Kubernetes

© 2025 Stephan Krusche, Ingo Weber

DevOps — W05 Cloud Integration and Deployment Platforms

80

Helm
•
•
•
•

De ne, version, and reuse Kubernetes con gurations
Supports templating, values injection, environment separation
Analogy: Terraform for K8s apps or Docker Compose for K8s
Helm charts are packages that contain all the Kubernetes resources needed to
deploy an application

• Including YAML les for deployments, services, secrets, and con g maps
• Simplify application deployment and management in Kubernetes by providing a
structured way to package, version, and share Kubernetes resources

Summary
• Deployment models: On-premise → IaaS → PaaS → SaaS → FaaS
• Tradeoff between more abstraction and less control
• Serverless: great for scaling and simplicity, but limited by cold starts and observability

• Cloud providers: AWS, Azure, GCP dominate; differ in tools, pricing, and ecosystem t
• Cloud trade-offs: abstraction increases speed but reduces transparency—security,
privacy, and cost optimization require active management (→ misconceptions)

• IaC motivation: cumbersome manual setups highlight need for automation
• Infrastructure as code
• Terraform provisions cloud infrastructure
• Ansible con gures servers
• Helm manages Kubernetes deployments

• Key insight: reliable DevOps needs infrastructure de ned and deployed as code
