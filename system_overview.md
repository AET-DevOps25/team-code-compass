**FlexFit â€“ System Overview (Submission)**

**1. Initial System Structure**

Describe how you plan to divide the system technically. You must cover: **Server (Spring Boot)**, **Client (React)**, **GenAI Service (Python/LangChain)**, and **Database**.

FlexFit will be developed as a distributed system composed of distinct components communicating over APIs. This modular approach facilitates independent development, deployment, and scaling.

*   **Server:** The backend logic will be implemented using **Spring Boot (Java)** exposing REST APIs, likely coordinated via an API Gateway (`api-gw`). To meet the requirement of multiple microservices, the server-side will be decomposed into:
    *   **User Service (`user-svc`):** Handles user profiles, preferences (sport type, equipment), authentication (JWT), and related data persistence.
    *   **Workout Plan Service (`plan-svc`):** Manages the creation, storage, retrieval, and high-level modification of the 7-day workout plans. It coordinates calls to the GenAI service for adaptive adjustments.
    *   **Session Service (Potentially part of `plan-svc` initially or separate):** Records completed workout sessions, including exercises performed, user feedback (RPE), and tracked metrics. Triggers plan updates via the Workout Plan Service.
    *   **Metrics Service (`metrics-svc`):** Exposes application metrics (e.g., via Spring Boot Actuator) for Prometheus scraping.
*   **Client (`client-web`):** A web-based frontend built using **React** (with Vite, MUI, TanStack Query). This provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for selecting sport types, viewing the daily workout, interacting during the session (including triggering voice cues via the browser's Web Speech API), providing feedback (RPE input), and viewing progress. It will communicate exclusively with the API Gateway.
*   **GenAI Service (`adaptive-planner`):** A dedicated microservice built with **Python** using **FastAPI** and **LangChain**. This service encapsulates all AI-driven logic: receives context from the `plan-svc`, performs RAG lookups against Weaviate, uses an LLM (cloud or local via `llm-local`) for adaptive reasoning, applies safety guardrails, and returns updated plan details.
*   **Database:**
    *   **PostgreSQL (`postgres`):** A relational database used by the Spring Boot services (`user-svc`, `plan-svc`) to store user data, workout plans, session history, RPE scores, and progress metrics. Managed via JPA/Flyway.
    *   **Weaviate (`weaviate`):** A vector database used by the `adaptive-planner` service, storing exercise descriptions, embeddings, and metadata (~1500 exercises) for efficient RAG retrieval.
*   **(Optional) Local LLM Service (`llm-local`):** A container serving a GGUF model (like Phi-3 or Llama) via an interface like `llama.cpp`, allowing local LLM inference if configured, potentially requiring GPU resources.
